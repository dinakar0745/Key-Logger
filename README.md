# Keylogger

## Overview

The Keylogger script is a Python-based tool that captures and logs keystrokes using the pynput library. It's designed to run in the background, monitoring keyboard inputs and storing them in a log file. Below is an overview of the script's features, prerequisites, installation steps, and usage instructions.

## Features

- **Keystroke Logging:** Captures and logs keystrokes made on the target machine.
- **Background Execution:** Runs discreetly in the background, unnoticed by the user.
- **Persistent Logging:** Appends keystrokes to a log file ('keyfile.txt') for later analysis.

## Prerequisites

- Python should installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- pynput library installed. Install it using the following command:
    ```bash
    pip install pynput
    ```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dinakar0745/Key-Logger.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Key-Logger
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install pynput
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
2. Background Monitoring:
The script will silently monitor keystrokes in the background.

## Example Output
